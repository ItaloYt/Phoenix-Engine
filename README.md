# Compiling the project
```
git clone https://github.com/ItaloYt/Phoenix-Engine
cd Phoenix-Engine
make
```
In the root directory of the repository will be two libraries(libphoenix.a and libphoenix.so), they're the same.
Also there's a bundler executable that's used in compile-time to bundle resources described in the resources.csv right 
into the source, so you don't need to load at runtime.
